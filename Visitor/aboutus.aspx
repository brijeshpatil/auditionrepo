        About Us</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Casting Networks, Inc. is a software company dedicated to providing business solutions
        for entertainment professionals. By creating tools for communication, scheduling,
        media management, marketing, career development, and talent scouting, we are streamlining
        some of the most complex processes facing the industry and creating an environment
        that will make it easier for these professionals to find work and get their jobs
        done. Starting in 2002 in San Francisco, Casting Director Beau Bonneau saw a need
        to reduce the seemingly endless quantity of paperwork and phone calls required to
        cast a project. With help from colleagues in the casting world, he developed the
        first system to put the entire casting process online. This system became known
        as "L.A. Casting." Casting Networks has since expanded to all of the major casting
        markets in the United States, and is the most trusted online casting service in
        the industry. Since its national expansion, Casting Networks continues to set the
        standard internationally and bridge the gap between Hollywood and the industry abroad.</p>
